    "# Project: Adult Dataset - Modeling üå∏\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project Name:** Adult Classification Project - Modeling\n",
    "- **Project Type:** Binary-class Classification\n",
    "- **Author:** Dr. Saad Laouadi\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the **modeling and evaluation** phase of the Adult Dataset project. After preprocessing the data in the previous notebook, this stage involves selecting, training, and evaluating different machine learning models to predict whether a person earns more than $50,000 annually based on demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Tasks:\n",
    "- **Algorithms Explored**:\n",
    "  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "  - Logistic Regression\n",
    "  - Decision Trees\n",
    "  - Random Forest\n",
    "  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "  - Gradient Boosting Machines\n",
    "  - Other relevant classifiers\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "  - Accuracy\n",
    "  - Precision\n",
    "  - Recall\n",
    "  - F1-score\n",
    "  - ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning classifiers using the preprocessed dataset.\n",
    "2. **Model Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search where necessary.\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\n",
    "4. **Model Comparison**: Compare the results of different models to select the best-performing one for this classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "Based on the results of the evaluation, we will explore strategies for further optimization, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model stacking.\n",
